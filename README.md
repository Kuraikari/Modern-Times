### How do I get set up? ###

*I'm alone, so what does the game do? Everything of course :P Nah just kidding...
*The game is gonna be a (J)RPG, so it needs some kind of "story". 
*I need my beloved Unity + Visual Studio.
*And well that's it. Not anything else.

*No external database.

*My tests are gonna run with some help of friends and other KOA members (Which aren't devs) 
*I don't think there is gonna be a deployment.
