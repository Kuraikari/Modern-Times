### How do I get set up? ###

* I'm alone, so what does the game do? Everything of course :P Nah just kidding...
* The game is gonna be a (J)RPG, so it needs some kind of "story". 
* I need my beloved Unity + Visual Studio.
* You need some minor graphics, to help clarify where what is is gonna be.
* And well that's it. Not anything else.

* No external database.

* My tests are gonna run with some help of friends and other KOA members (Which aren't devs) 
* I don't think there is gonna be a deployment.
