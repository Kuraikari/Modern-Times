ToDo-List for this week:

- Check if the Serializer.Save<>() overrides the save files unasked or not. (good-to-know)
- Change how the Teleport and the SceneManager overall works. (important)
- Start to implement the SocialManager Lists, so it can be pre-loaded. (no biggie)
- Continue to work on the Intro (needed but not so urgent)
- Pixel some NPCs to get a more lifely world. (needed but not so urgent)
- Try to create Events for Story Progression. (needed but not so urgent)
