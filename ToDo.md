## ToDo-List for this week: ##

01) Check if the Serializer.Save<>() overrides the save files unasked or not. (good-to-know)
02) Change how the Teleport and the SceneManager overall works. (important)
03) Start to implement the SocialManager Lists, so it can be pre-loaded. (no biggie)
04) Continue to work on the Intro (needed but not so urgent)
05) Pixel some NPCs to get a more lifely world. (needed but not so urgent)
06) Try to create Events for Story Progression. (needed but not so urgent)
07) Create a StoryEventManager. (in addition to 06)
