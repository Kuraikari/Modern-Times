#What is Modern Times (J)RPG?#
Modern Times (J)RPG is an idea to a game which hasn't been before. It is big, strongly item based and has a lot of
mechanics which we are familiar with. The 4-Ability system, round based combat, walking with WASD-Keys and so on.

##But what is Modern Times(J)RPG for the developer(myself)?##
Well, this game is mainly a a sideproject and a way to use my freetime for my most beloved hobby: programming. 
I always wanted to develope games as a kid. I think a  lot of people wanted this in their lifetime. So I tried,
and succeded. But all of the games were so small projects, that it didn't fully pleasure my needs. I wanted more!

##Why this game?##
Honestly, I don't know. I love Japan, I love games(especially RPGs) and I love programming. I really loved the anime "Chuunibyou",
so I thought I could try to create an more or less original story around that. And pretty much I love it. :D
If someone would read the written story... jesus christ... xD You feel so much my hatred for the entire humanity... xD
It's kinda aggravating but in the same time so much fun to read what he thinks. xD 

##Which written Story?##
Well... To have the slightest idea what the story would be I began to sketch some ideas about him and the environment around him.
It was okay, but it was so raw and unpolished. Myself, I couldn't imagine how it felt like being in his shoes. 
So I tried to write a short story, about everything. And this whole thing is written in his POV. So you know only his thoughts.
And geez... I don't know if I overdone it or not. Seriously I don't have a clue xD
